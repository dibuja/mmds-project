# Introduction detecting changes in cropland
Due to Climate Change, food scarcity and decreased crops are threatening crop yields all around the world. According to some studies, the probability of crop yield failures is projected to increase 4.5 times by 2030 and up to 25 times by 2050 [1]. The crop yields are expected to significantly decrease in the future years, with expected losses of 9â€“28% for maize, 7-22% for wheat, 4-12% for soy or 3-11% for rice [2]. 

Is it possible to detect changes in cropland using satellite images? We have tried to answer this question so by using satellite images of croplands and trying to implement

- unsupervised clustering methods; and 
- supervised classification 

in order to detect changes in croplands that could help in providing insights related to crop yields.
