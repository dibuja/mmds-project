# MMDS Project: Detecting Deforestation in Europe throughout 2022
=====================

This project is part of the course "Mining of Massive Datasets" from EAFIT Univerity. It aims at detecting areas of land where deforestation happened during 2022 throughout Europe. For that, we are using satellite imagery from [Sentinel 2](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2/). We will be using unsupervised clustering methods combined with pre-processing that will allow us to discern forest images from other types of land.
